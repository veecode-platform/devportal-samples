# devportal-samples

This repo contains several VeeCode DevPortal examples for local testing.

Each example tries to be self sufficient as possible, containing all the necessary files and configurations. External settings may be required, like API keys, tokens or certificates (like those required by Github).

## Prerequisites

Each example has its own prerequisites. Please check the README.md file of each example for more details.

## Examples
