#
# This is a dynamic plugins config file bundled with the devportal-base image.
# It is used to define the behaviour of the dynamic plugins system pre-startup.
#
# Plugins at "dynamic-plugins-root" will be loaded at startup, and its default 
# content is defined by the "dynamic-plugins" workspace (downloads and wrappers).
# This file defines, on the other hand, defines the plugins that will be copied 
# into the "dynamic-plugins-root" folder during startup.
#
# It is important to undertand: pre-installed plugins are bundled with the image.
# They are forcibly loaded at startup if placed in the "dynamic-plugins-root" folder.
# They are **not** forcibly loaded if kept somewhere else.
#
# This config file will enumerate plugins that:
#
# 1. Are bundled in the image file system, but outside the "dynamic-plugins-root" folder.
# 2. Are not bundled in the image, but are available for download.
#
# A start script will process this file and make sure enabled plugins are copied
# into the "dynamic-plugins-root" folder *and* that their configuration gets merged
# into a proper dedicated "app-config" file.
#
includes:
  # Always start by merging the defaults that ship inside the image
  # That makes it easy to enable plugins with defaults that would otherwise
  # be painful to configure.
